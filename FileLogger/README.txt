# Comments to Evaluators:
The following was written to allow us the manipulation a logger for the GUI to be able to communicate with the server 
and client code, giving us the access we needed for the chat log and it's histoty.

# Assignment Specific Topics: 
Create a Custom FileLogger class for use in a networking system, as well as a provider to go along with it.

# Justification for logging at an Information level:
This was meant to serve as more or less a finished product, and as such we decided to use "information" level logging as it seemed the best fit for our needs.
